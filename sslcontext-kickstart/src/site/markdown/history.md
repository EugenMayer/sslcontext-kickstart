### History
As a Java developer I worked for different kinds of clients. Most of the time the application required to call other microservices within the organization or some other http servers. 
It was required to be HTTPS configured and so I began writing the code which was needed to configure the Http Client to communicate over ssl/tls. And every time I needed to write almost the same code over and over again which is in my opinion very verbose and hard to unit test.

As a developer you need to know how to properly load your file into your application and consume it as a KeyStore instance. Therefor you also need to learn how to properly create a KeyManagerFactory, TrustManagerFactory and SSLContext. 
Traditional creation of SSLContext can be rewritten if you use a Http Client which relies on libraries of Jetty or Netty and therefor it makes it even more complex.
The sslcontext-kickstart library is taking the responsibility of creating an instance of SSLContext from the provided arguments. I wanted to be as easy as possible to use to give every developer a kickstart when configuring their Http Client. So feel free to provide feedback or feature requests.
The library also provide other utilities such as [KeyStoreUtils](https://github.com/Hakky54/sslcontext-kickstart/blob/master/sslcontext-kickstart/src/main/java/nl/altindag/sslcontext/util/KeyStoreUtils.java), [KeyManagerUtils](https://github.com/Hakky54/sslcontext-kickstart/blob/master/sslcontext-kickstart/src/main/java/nl/altindag/sslcontext/util/KeyManagerUtils.java) and [TrustManagerUtils](https://github.com/Hakky54/sslcontext-kickstart/blob/master/sslcontext-kickstart/src/main/java/nl/altindag/sslcontext/util/TrustManagerUtils.java). See the [javadoc](https://sslcontext-kickstart.com/apidocs/index.html) for all the options.
